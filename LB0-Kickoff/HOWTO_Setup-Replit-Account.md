# **HOWTO Setup a Repl.it Account**
###### Last update: 4/9/23 dbe - adapted to repl.it

## What is REPL.IT?  
**Replit** is an online coding platform (aka *integrated development environment* (**IDE**)) that allows you to write, run, and collaborate on code from anywhere with an internet connection. With Replit, you don't need to worry about setting up your own development environment or installing software. Everything is done in the browser, so you can focus on coding.  This online coding platform supports over 50 languages and many programming courses use it, including [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn).

## Create your personal REPL.IT Account

Before you can start using the Repl.it programming environment in the cloud, you need to create a personal account.  
</br>
- **Sign In**

To get started, you will first need to go to the [Replit homepage](https://replit.com/). In the top right hand corner, click on [Sign Up](https://replit.com/signup).

</br>

## Create your first Repl

You may then create your **first Repl**, your *first read-eval-print-loop* programming environment by clicking on the top left hand corner **+ Create Repl**.  
Then you can choose from a list of templates **your preferred programming language** environment (e.g. *P5JS* for an easy to use Javascript library)

</br>

As a result, your selected coding environment will be setup as a single virtual machine, where you can handle programm files, edit and run programm code. An example of the coding environment for a P5JS template is given below
